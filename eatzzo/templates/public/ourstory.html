            <h1 class="os-h1">Remember Real Food?</h1>
            <p class="os-p">Eatzzo was born from a simple realization: in our fast-paced world, many of <br>
                us are missing the comfort, health benefits, and cultural connection that <br>
                comes with homely cooked meals. While fast food and restaurants are <br>
                convenient, they often lack the nutritional value and emotional satisfaction of <br>
                food made with care in home kitchens.</p>

            <p class="os-p">As two friends passionate about technology and food, we saw an opportunity <br>
                to bridge this gap. We envisioned a platform that world:</p>
            <ul class="os-ul">
                <li> Connect people craving homely food with talented home cooks in their <br>
                    community </li><br>
                <li> Preserve and share cultural food traditions</li><br>
                <li> Provide healthy alternatives to fast food </li><br>
                <li> Create earning opportunities for home-based cooks</li><br>
                <li> Reduced food waste through donations to those in need</li>
            </ul>
